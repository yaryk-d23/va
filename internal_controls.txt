Beneficiary\u2019s file (Note&#58; If the claim is a VBMS claim \u2013 log onto VBMS to view the supporting documentation)<br>b. Evidence, such as a DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty or service document, that lists the Veteran's service number,<br>c. Screenshot of the Corporate \u2013 Claims/Denials Information Tab (Note&#58; Depending on what process owners prefer, you can also observe this tab within the system, instead of requesting a screenshot.)<br>4. Verify that the claim was CESTed in a reasonable time. This is important because the claimant could submit a new claim, and if the original claim is not CESTed, the risk for a duplicate record and potential duplicate payment increases significantly. <br>a. Compare the date of claim on the supporting documentation to the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d field within the Corporate-Claims/Denials Information Tab. The date of claim on the supporting documentation is usually the earliest VA date stamp indicated on the supporting documentation. However, if the supporting documentation was submitted electronically (e.g., an application submitted via VONAPP or an electronic hospitalization report), the date of claim is the submission date, which is typed on the lower right side of the document. <br>a. If the date of claim on the supporting documentation and the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d field within the Corporate-Claims/Denials Information tab do not match, determine whether the Veteran filed a pre-discharge claim. If the date stamp pre-dates the Veteran\u2019s release date (as indicated on the Veteran\u2019s DD 214), the date of claim should be the day after the Veteran was released from active duty. <br>b. If the date of claim on the supporting documentation and the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d field within the Corporate-Claims/Denials Information tab do not match, inquire with process owners. <br>b. Determine the CEST date. The CEST date corresponds to the date the claim was opened. (Note&#58; This is indicated within the \u201cLife Cycle Status\u201d field.)<br>c. Compute how many days it took the Claims Assistant (CA) to CEST the claim. Compare the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d field (identified in step 4a) to the CEST date (identified in step 4b). <br>a. If the CEST date was within seven days from the \u201cClaim Date\u201d, this indicates the CA CESTed the claim in a timely manner in accordance with internal guidelines. Continue to step 5. <br>b. If the CEST date exceeds seven days from the \u201cClaim Date\u201d, review the application to determine if the earliest VA date stamp is from another station of jurisdiction. <br>i. If yes, determine whether the \u201cEstablishment Date\u201d is within a month of the &quot;Date of Claim.&quot; If so, the CA CESTed the claim in a timely manner. If not, inquire with process owners. <br>ii. If the claim was not first sent to another station of jurisdiction, inquire with process owners regarding why it took the CA so long to establish the claim. Request a screenshot of the &quot;Corporate - Claims/Denial Information&quot; tab that indicates the &quot;Date of Claim&quot; field and the CEST date.<br>5. Verify there are no duplicate records for the claimant by observing an experienced CA perform a search within the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) -VBA Ready Screen. Request that the experienced CA perform a search in the following manner&#58;<br>a. Search the Veteran's service number (The Veteran\u2019s service number can be found on the application, DD 214, or other service document); <br>b. Search a combination of the claimant's name. If the claimant has a middle initial, request that the CA perform the search with and without the middle initial. Also, be aware of names that can be shortened. For example, James may be shortened to Jim. For these instances, request that the process owner perform the search for the claimant\u2019s full name as well as any potential nicknames. These are the type of issues that most often lead to duplicate records; <br>c. Search the claimant\u2019s SSN; and <br>d. Search the claimant\u2019s file number, if applicable (Usually older Veteran\u2019s file numbers are not their SSN).<br>6.

Accuracy of Mailing/Payment Address&#58; The method for verifying the accuracy of the mailing and payment address varies depending on whether the Veteran is competent. To make this determination, review the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field within the Award Document.&#160; (Note&#58; Incorrect mailing and payments addresses can lead to returned payments and, as a result, proceeds. In addition, incorrect mailing and payment addresses can lead to improper payments if the wrong person accepts the payment.)<br>i.

If the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field indicates \u201cIncompetent,\u201d and the \u201cFiduciary Status\u201d field indicates that the beneficiary is assigned a fiduciary, verify that the \u201cMailing Address\u201d on the Award Document matches the most recent evidence of the fiduciary's mailing and payment address, which is evidenced on the VA Form 21-555 and VETSNET-C-FID Screen. If this is not correct, mark this as an exception.&#160; <br>d. Accuracy of Direct Deposit Information&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s application (Section XI) or direct deposit information that the Veteran submitted (i.e., copy of a voided check) to determine whether the Veteran has direct deposit. If the Veteran has direct deposit, ensure that the bank name, routing, and account number shown within the Award Document is correct. If the information is incorrect, the payment is going to the wrong account and can lead to an improper benefit payment. Mark this as an exception.&#160;&#160; <br>e.

The \u201cAward Incd\u201d column of the Person Information tab indicates if the dependent is included in the Veteran\u2019s award. (Note&#58; VA does not require the Veteran to submit official documentation to evidence the existence of their dependents. In other words, the VSC takes the Veteran\u2019s word, unless the VSC finds conflicting documentation.)&#160; <br>Ensure that a dependent\u2019s name, date of birth, status (e.g., spouse, child, etc.) and SSN match. Incorrect dependency information can lead to an improper payment. Mark this as an exception.<br>f. Review the Veterans\u2019 certified DD 214, PIES request, and/or BIRLS VADS screen. Compare the DD 214, PIES request, and/or BIRLS VADS screen to the Award Document to ensure that the \u201cBranch,\u201d \u201cDuty,\u201d \u201cEOD,\u201d \u201cRAD,\u201d and \u201cChar Disch.\u201d fields are accurate.&#160; If there is a discrepancy in the \u201cChar Disch.\u201d field, inquire with process owners. <br>i. If any of the service documentation indicates the Veteran was discharged under other than honorable conditions, request a copy of the Administrative Decision that outlines VA\u2019s determination of the character of discharge. If VA determined that the Veteran\u2019s discharge is dishonorable for VA purposes (DVA), or if the Veteran was discharged under dishonorable conditions and&#160; VA did not prepare an Administrative Decision, mark the case as an exception. The Veteran should not be receiving benefits if discharged under other than honorable conditions. <br>g. Compare the Rating Decision to the Veteran\u2019s application for benefits. Verify that each contention or issue the Veteran claimed in his application was addressed in the Rating Decision. In addition, verify that the decisions outlined in the Rating Decision agree with the decisions outlined in the Award Document. <br>h. If the \u201cDis. Lvl\u201d column within the \u201cCompensation Award\u201d section of the Award Document indicates the Veteran receives SMC benefits, review the \u201cDecision\u201d and \u201cReason for Decision\u201d sections of the Rating Decision to verify that the Veteran meets SMC requirements. <br>i. If there is an amount in the \u201cTotal W/H\u201d column of the \u201cCompensation Award\u201d section of the Award Document or separate sections on the Award Document for \u201cGross Retired Pay\u201d and \u201cSeverance Pay,&quot; request a process owner walk through the withholding calculation and effective date. If the withholding is inaccurate, this can lead to an improper payment. <br>If there is not any indication of withholdings on the Award Document or that the Veteran receives retired pay, etc., review the following indications to determine whether the Veteran is in receipt of these types of payments and inquire with process owners why&#160; VA did not withhold benefits. <br>i. Retired Pay&#58; <br>\u2022 The \u201cType of Separation\u201d field within the Veteran\u2019s DD 214 indicates that the Veteran receives \u201ctemporary disability retired,\u201d \u201cretired disability,\u201d or \u201cretired length of service;\u201d <br>\u2022 Field 23a within Part V of the Veteran\u2019s VA Form 21-526. indicates he/she receives retired pay;<br>\u2022 The \u201cRetired Pay Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)\u201d section within the BIRLS Misc. Information Tab indicates the current and prior gross retired pay amounts that the Veteran receives and the corresponding effective dates; <br>\u2022 The VETSNET-C&amp;P Awards main screen displays a \u201cRetired Pay Case\u201d indicator in the upper right corner of the screen. In addition, the VETSNET-C&amp;P Awards \u2013 Retired Pay screen indicates the Veteran\u2019s history of receiving retired pay. <br>ii. Lump Sum Payments&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s PEB (if applicable), DD 214, Award Document, and inquire with process owners whether the Veteran receives lump sum benefits. Types of lump sum benefits include readjustment pay, non-disability severance pay, separation pay, reservists\u2019 involuntary separation pay, special separation benefits, voluntary separation pay, and disability severance pay. <br>iii. Apportionments&#58; Inquire with process owners whether the Veteran pays an apportionment of his benefits to a dependent. <br>j. Verify the effective date on the Award Document is accurate. The effective date should be the month following the date of claim. If there is a discrepancy, inquire with process owners. <br>5. Review the Award Document and verify that a Senior&#160; Veterans Service Representative (SVSR) authorized the award. The IDs should be different for the generation and authorization. If the award is in excess of $25,000, verify that a Coach or designee concurred with the award within VETSNET-Awards. The individual who concurred the decision must have a different ID than the individuals who generated and authorized the award.</div>","Control_Status":"A.

Request a population of dependency changes (end-product (EP) 130s) from Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Office of Performance Analysis and Integrity (PAI) completed within the testing period. This population should indicate the reason for the change in dependency. Also, request an EP 130 Completions report, with the claim label type included (e.g., ebenefits or dependency), from VBA Office of Field Operations (OFO). (Note&#58; The total amount within the Award is not always related to the dependency, as the Award may include a dual EP.) <br>2. Utilizing both reports, select a sample of 45 claims and 10 additional samples from the population. Ensure approximately 50 percent of the samples selected are ebenefits, and approximately 50 percent are regular dependency claims. (Note&#58; Request that the OFO request the Regional Office (RO) run a COVERS Report for the selected samples to determine if the claims have an electronic file (VBMS or Virtual VA) or a c-file. If a claim selected has a c-file, randomly select an electronic claim from the additional samples selected. Additionally, if PAI is able to provide the reason for the change in dependency, ensure that the samples selected reflect benefit payments that changed due to the following&#58;&#160; death of a child or spouse, divorce, remarriage, child turning 18, discontinuance of school attendance, birth of a child, or marriage.)<br>3. Each of the samples selected has a date of claim. Only review the dependency change that is relevant to the date of claim selected for review. Each time a Veteran submits a Declaration of Status of Dependency Change (VA 21-686c) form, they must include all of their current dependents. However, this does not necessarily mean that there is a change in dependency status for each dependent. Compare the current VA 21-686c with the previous VA 21-696c to determine what changed (e.g. divorce, marriage, birth of child, etc.). Review only the action(s) that changed. There may be more than one action to review. For example, the Veteran may have added a marriage and two new step children. <br>4. Review documentation within the c-file/ Virtual VA/ Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to see if the notification of dependency changes was received from a third party. If the notification was received from a third party (as opposed to the Veteran submitting dependency changes through ebenefits or VA Form 21 \u2013 686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents), verify that VA granted due-process, not making an adjustment to the Award until the 60-day due process period expired, to allow the beneficiary time to confirm the change. <br>5. Verify that the personally identifiable information (PII) (name, social security number (SSN), date of birth, relationship to claimant) of the dependent(s) on the dependency change documentation (VA Form 21 \u2013 686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents or VA Form 21-080, etc.) within the c-file/Virtual VA/ VBMS matches VETSNET. The table below includes the PII information the Veteran must provide VA for the various dependency changes. Also, review the additional PII components within the table are provided by the Veteran and there is not conflicting information within the c-file/Virtual VA/ VBMS. <br>a.

Verify that the effective date of the change is correct. This workpaper has several hidden columns with formulas to determine whether the effective date is correct. Unhide the columns and enter the data. If Attribute E has a &quot;#&quot;, recheck the dates to make sure that there truly is an error. This is because the rules for the effective date are complicated. The VA's policies for the effective date are more lenient than the Code of Federal Regulations. The effective date is the later of the SC 30% designation or&#160; the date of the event (e.g. marriage, birth, etc.) as long as the Veteran notifies VA within one year of receiving the letter that they are SC 30% or within one year of the date of the event. If the Veteran notifies the VA of dependency after 1 year, the effective date of the dependency is the date that the Veteran notified the VA. In all of these situations, the benefits for the dependent will start on the first of the following month. Please keep in mind that while a dependency claim is typically made on a VA Form 21 \u2013 686c, any notification that the Veteran makes to VA is considered a claim. For example, the Veteran could call, write, or submit other documentation notifying the VA of the dependent. This documentation may be several years old given the amount of time that VA takes to process dependency claims. It may be necessary in some cases to search through very old records in VBMS and Virtual VA to find when the Veteran first notified the VA of the dependent. For example, a Veteran may have notified the VA of a marriage 5 years prior to the current claim to add the spouse as a dependent, which the VA may have denied because the Veteran was not yet SC 30%. Once the Veteran becomes SC 30%, they do not have to notify the VA again to add the spouse as a dependent. In this case, the effective date for the spouse would be the first of the month following the SC 30% date because the Veteran notified VA of the marriage prior to the SC 30% date. As a result, it may be necessary to review the records from 5 years prior to the current claim to determine when the Veteran first notified VA of the marriage to determine the correct effective date.&#160; Request that the process owners review any errors related to the effective date to ensure there are no mitigating circumstances. <br>7. Verify that there is no conflicting information in the file. For example, in FY 2015 testing, a Veteran called the VA to inform them of his child's birth. The date of birth was subsequent to the date that the Veteran notified VA. It is not appropriate for the Veteran to notify the VA of child's birth before the child is born, regardless of circumstance (e.g. planned caesarean).&#160; In this case, the VA should have requested a birth certificate to support the date of birth. They did not, and it was an exception because the VA should not have added the child to the award without the supporting documentation. This led to an overpayment to the Veteran. If there is conflicting information, review the VBMS and Virtual VA records to verify that the VA requested and received documentation or other information to support the claim. <br>8. If the claim is not electronic, verify that the generator and authorizer reviewed the adjustment to the Award, as evidenced by their signatures within the Award. If the adjustment to the Award exceeds $25,000, verify that a Coach or designee reviewed the adjustment to the Award, as evidenced by his or her signature within the Award. The signatures within the Award should be different. This attribute is NA if the claim is electronic.</div>","Control_Status":"A.

If a variance is noted and it exceeds Treasury's materiality threshold, verify how the variance was resolved. If the variance was resolved through a MinX JV in the current or subsequent quarter, perform testing steps D, E, and F. If the variance is resolved through other means, make a note of how the variance has been or will be resolved. If the variance is still under research, verify that it was included on the Material Differences Report and the Additional Explanations Report with an explanation and corrective action plan. <br>&#160; <br>4. Obtain the associated MinX JV (should include the &quot;created by&quot; and &quot;prepared by&quot; user IDs) and review it to ensure that the Supervisory Accountant [Management Financial Reporting Service] MFRS or designee approved the JV. The &quot;posted by&quot; entry should contain the user ID of the Supervisory Accountant MFRS to evidence their approval.<br>&#160;<br>5. Verify that the MinX JV accurately reflects the variance as noted in the IFCS printout.<br>&#160;<br>6. Verify that the debits and credits on the MinX JV equal and are posted to the correct accounts.</p></div>","Control_Status":"A.

Verify the Claimant was eligible for education benefits by reviewing that the Claimant submitted an application within a year of taking the corresponding courses. Review the dates of the course on the VA Once form submitted by the education institution. The start date of the courses should be one year prior to the application date for the entire enrollment period to be considered applicable. <br>a. If the start date of the enrollment period on the VA Once form is more than one year prior to the Claimant\u2019s application date, VA will use one year prior to the application date as the Claimant\u2019s effective date to pay the Claimant a portion of Education benefits. For example, if the Claimant started taking classes on March 1, 2014, but did not submit the application until April 1, 2015, the VA will pay Education benefit starting on April 1, 2014 to provide a portion of education benefits to the Claimant.<br>b. The VA is currently reviewing the Education benefit given to Veterans for flight school. A Veteran will submit a V1995 form if enrolling in flight school classes. Additionally, the institution may note that the Claimant is taking flight classes on the VA Once form. If the VA Once form does not indicate the courses are for flight school, the RPO might be able to identify that it is for flight courses based on high tuition and fees. Inquire with the RPO what the policy was for the time period requested to understand if Veterans should be receiving Education benefits for flight school.</p><p>5. For all Chapters besides Chapter 1607 (See Step 5.b),verify the Claimant had a minimum of three years of service by viewing the VADIR Information Report, or by confirming that the Claimant received a Certificate of Eligibility letter. The service information on the VADIR report should match the information on the LTS Screen Print and the DD 214 because DOD automatically updates VADIR, which interfaces with VA\u2019s LTS system. LTS notes which periods of service are eligible for Education benefits, which does not include certain tours of duty and training periods. Using the testing work paper, input the eligible start and end dates for service to calculate how many years the Claimant served. If they have not served for 3 years, verify if the VA sent them a Certificate of Eligibility for Education benefits. If not, inquire with process owners. <br>a. If reviewing a Chapter 30 claim, a Veteran must opt in to the program and agree to a deduction from their military pay. Review the 30D BDN screen, a 05P, 06P, 03, or 04 code with an amount listed next to it indicates that the Veteran opted in to the program and is eligible for Chapter 30 benefits. Additionally, on the 30D BDN screen, a 04 without an amount next to the code indicates that the Veteran declined the deduction and is not eligible for Chapter 30 benefits. If the Veteran is receiving Chapter 30 Education benefits, verify they opted in and had the benefit cost deducted.<br>b. If reviewing a Chapter 1607 claim, there is no minimum year of service requirement. Verify that there is a REAP Eligibility form or VADIR form. </p><p>6. If the Veteran had an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge, which will be noted on the VADIR screen and/or on the DD 214, verify that the RPO developed an Administrative Decision prior to the Award payment. The Veteran only needs one period of honorable service that is greater than the three year eligibility period to automatically qualify for Education benefits.</p><p>7. Verify the Claimant is enrolled in classes by reviewing the Enrollment Certification VA Once form, which is sent to the RPO by the education institution. The education institution should send the VA Once form automatically any time the Claimant enrolls in or changes any classes. The VA Once form should show the institution the Claimant is attending, how many credits being taken, the tuition costs, the dates of enrollment, and any additional comments the institution included. If the RPO cannot locate the VA Once form, or the institution never sent one, verify the Claimant's file has a WEAMs screenshot to verify the courses in which the Claimant is enrolled. <br>a. The Veteran can update their credits and enrollment dates multiple times. If this is the case, there will be multiple VA Once forms in their file. Use the most recent VA Once form received from the institution when calculating the benefit paid.</p><p>8. Recalculate the Education Award the Claimant received for accuracy. The final amount the Claimant received will be on the LTS WPS. Use the benefit calculator to verify the Award amount. Enter the rate amount for the Chapter and the dates the Claimant was attending the institution from the VA Once form. Verify that this amount matches the amount the Claimant received.<br>Rate information for each Education Chapter can be found here&#58; <a href=\"http&#58;//www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch1607\">http&#58;//www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp#ch1607</a> <br>a. If reviewing a Chapter 30 claim, VA pays a flat rate if the Claimant is attending the institution more than half time. Review the Claimant\u2019s VA Once form to determine how many hours the Claimant is enrolled in.<br>i. Twelve semester hours or more is considered full time. <br>ii. Nine to eleven semester hours is considered three quarter training time.&#160; <br>iii. Six to eight semester hours is considered half time.&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>b. If reviewing a Chapter 30, 1607, or 35, where the Claimant is on active duty or enrolled in school less than half time, tuition amounts from the VA Once form are necessary. The VA uses the tuition amounts instead of the set amounts on the website to determine how much of the benefit the Claimant will receive.<br>c. The Claimant could be eligible for a kicker or $600 buy up under Chapter 30, 1606, and 1607, which would be noted on DA Form 3286-66 ( need the front and back of this form). The kicker is an additional amount of up to $150 a month the Claimant would receive on top of the benefit payment. This amount should be included in the total that was paid to the Claimant. If the Veteran is a Marine and eligible for a kicker, the kicker amount is on the 30D screen. Kickers are verified with DOD and that is the document VA looks to verify a kicker.</p><p>9. Verify the RPO sent the Claimant\u2019s Education benefit payment to the institution by reviewing the LTS screenshot and/or the BDN screenshot. The total amount on these screens should match the recalculated amount completed in Step 8. BDN cannot accept Big Pays over $40,000 and will split these up into two or more transactions. Note&#58; There is no set guidance that outlines how payments over $40,000 should be processed to ensure the whole benefit amount is paid. These payments can be processed in more than one way. Ask the process owner if they have local policy or how they expect these transactions to be processed.</p><p>10. For Chapter 35 Awards, verify the Veteran responded to the Certificate of Eligibility within 30 days of the letter selecting the effective date. </p><p>11. Verify the Award was authorized correctly. <br>a. An Award between $8,000 and $12,000 should be authorized by a Unit Chief or Coach. Review the Big Pay note in TIMs to confirm there were three separate verifications (VCE, SVCE, and a Unit Chief or Coach).Compare the employee user name from the three approvals on the Big Pay note to the user names and position information on the HR list provided by the RPO. (Note&#58; The Big Pay note shows the verbiage from the final approver but does not show the user name of the final approver when printed. If we do not have TIMS access, work with the point of contact from the RPO to view all Big Pay notes in the TIMs system.) <br>b. An Award over $12,000 should also be authorized by the Assistant Director or Director in addition to the Unit Chief or Coach. Request the authorizations completed by the Assistant Director or Director for those payments over $12,000 to confirm they reviewed the payments and approved them.</p><p>12. Verify the Education benefit payment was reviewed on the FOES report. There will either be a signature, initials, or a checkmark evidencing review on the FOES report.</p></div>","Control_Status":"A.

Director/Assistant Director approval of payments over $20,000</p><p>3. Verify the Claimant\u2019s service dates recorded in VADIR were accurately transferred to LTS by comparing the dates listed on the screen prints from the two systems. LTS might only list the dates that are eligible for the Education benefit, and might exclude dates, such as training. VADIR automatically interfaces with LTS to update the service dates, so the VA does not manually update this information. Additionally, verify the Claimant\u2019s service was eligible for the Chapter 33 benefits by inputting the service entry and exit dates into the testing workpapers to ensure the Veteran served for at least 90 days of active duty service after September 10, 2001 and received an honorable discharge for a percentage of maximum benefit payable. To receive a 100% of maximum benefits, the Veteran must serve for at least 3 years of active duty after September 10, 2001. <br>a. If the Veteran had an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge, which will be noted on the VADIR screen and/or on the DD 214, verify that the RPO developed an Administrative Decision prior to the Award payment. </p><p>4. If the Veteran did not serve for the minimum number of months required, review their TIMs file to locate a COE from the VA confirming they are eligible to receive the benefit. <br>a. A Veteran\u2019s eligible service dates are typically active duty dates after September 11, 2001. <br>b. Additionally, some National Guard or Reserve Time may qualify. Training dates do not qualify. Review LTS and compare to VADIR for the eligible service dates for the Veteran. </p><p>5. Verify the Claimant was eligible for education benefits by reviewing that the Claimant submitted an application within a year of taking the corresponding courses. Review the dates of the course on the VA Once form submitted by the education institution. The start date of the courses should be one year prior to the application date for the entire enrollment period to be considered applicable. Verify the Claimant was receiving the correct Eligibility rate based on the Claimant\u2019s service dates. Refer to <a href=\"http&#58;//www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/handouts_forms.asp\">www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/handouts_forms.asp</a> to determine and confirm the rate the Claimant was supposed to be receiving based on the Post-9/11 GI Bill Pamphlet.&#160; <br>a. If the start date of the enrollment period on the VA Once form is more than one year prior to the Claimant\u2019s application date, VA will use one year prior to the application date as the Claimant\u2019s effective date to pay the Claimant a portion of Education benefits. For example, if the Claimant started taking classes on March 1, 2014, but did not submit the application until April 1, 2015, the VA will pay Education benefit starting on April 1, 2014 to provide a portion of education benefits to the Claimant.<br>b. The VA is currently reviewing the Education benefit given to Veterans for flight school. A Veteran will submit a V1995 form if enrolling in flight school classes. Additionally, the institution may note that the Claimant is taking flight classes on the VA Once form. If the VA Once form does not indicate the courses are for flight school, the RPO might be able to identify that it is for flight courses based on high tuition and fees. Inquire with the RPO what the policy was for the time period requested to understand if Veterans should be receiving Education benefits for flight school. </p><p>6. Verify the Claimant is enrolled in classes by reviewing the VA Once form, which is sent to the RPO by the education institution. The education institution should sent the VA Once form automatically any time the Claimant enrolls in or changes any classes. The VA Once form should show the institution the Claimant is attending, how many credits being taken, the tuition costs, the dates of enrollment, and any additional comments the institution included. If the RPO cannot locate the VA Once form, or the institution never sent one, verify the Claimant's file has a WEAMs screenshot to verify the courses in which the Claimant is enrolled. <br>a. The Veteran can update their credits and enrollment dates multiple times. If this is the case, there will be multiple VA Once forms in their file. Make sure to use the most recent VA Once form received from the institution when calculating the benefit paid.</p><p>7. Recalculate the education Award amount the Claimant received to ensure it is accurate. The final amount the Claimant received will be on the LTS WPS.&#160; To obtain the correct Award amount, multiply the Eligibility Rate based on the number of years in service (<a href=\"https&#58;//gibill.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/947\">https&#58;//gibill.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/947</a>)&#160;&#160; to the Tuition amount listed on the on the VA Once form. Utilize the VA\u2019s benefit calculator tool in Excel to determine if the Claimant received the correct Award amount. (Need <br>a. BDN has a system limitation where the maximum Award amount that can be paid is $40,000. If the Award amount is greater than $40,000, verify a second payment was made, and verify the total of the two amounts matches to the recalculated amount.<br>b. For Big Pays over $40,000, although not a requirement, the RPOs should create two LTS work products, which will process correctly in BDN. If the RPO processes a payment over $40,000 in LTS, BDN will reject the payment and then the processor must create two separate payments in BDN and BDN can only process one payment a day.</p><p>8. Verify the Award was authorized correctly. <br>a. An Award+Y7 under $20,000 should be authorized by a Veteran Claims Examiner. Review the Big Pay note in TIMs to confirm there were verifications. Compare the employee user name from the approvals on the Big Pay note to the user names and position information on the HR list provided by the RPO. (Note&#58; The Big Pay note shows the verbiage from the final approver but does not show the user name of the final approver when printed. If we do not have TIMS access, work with the point of contact from the RPO to view all Big Pay notes in the TIMs system.) <br>b. An Award over $20,000 should be approved by the VCE and two Coaches/Unit Chiefs and reported to the Assistant Director or Director. </p></div>","Control_Status":"A.

The Veteran was discharged under honorable conditions&#58; The Veteran's DD 214, PIES request response, DPRIS request response, or other service documentation and the BIRLS-Vets Identification Data tab will indicate the Veteran\u2019s discharge conditions.

The Veteran identified on the application is deceased&#58; The deceased Veteran's personal identifiable information such as name, Social Security Number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death indicated on the proof of death agrees with the deceased Veteran's name (Field 1), SSN (Field 2), date of birth (Field 7A), and date of death (Field 8A) listed on the VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Benefits. <br>c. The correct claimant received the award&#58; The claimant's name (Field 4A) and mailing address (Field 6) and the Veteran's SSN/ File Number (Field 2 and 3) indicated on VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Benefits matches the &quot;Name and Address - Payee&quot; and &quot;Social Security&quot; and &quot;File Number&quot; fields within the Award Document. (Note&#58; Old Veteran's may have a File Number in place of a SSN.) If the claimant name and address does not match, inquire with process owners. (Note&#58; Sometimes&#160; VA finds that the claimant did not pay for the funeral bill or portions of the funeral bill. In this situation,&#160; VA may refund the person or organization that authorized (i.e., provided) the funeral services.)<br>d. The receipt of payment (invoice) for the funeral proves that the claimant paid for the funeral expenses. (Note&#58; Invoices may be formatted differently, however most invoices have a &quot;Balance Due&quot; field. If the &quot;Balance Due Field&quot; equals zero, this is a good indication the claimant paid for the full amount of funeral expenses. If the claimant still owes money to the authorizer (e.g., provider of funeral services),&#160; VA may provide the authorizer the reimbursement. If this is the case, inquire with process owners.)<br>e. Field 21A within the VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Benefits indicates that the claimant did not receive reimbursement for the funeral expenses from another government agency or other source.

If the burial claim met the basic requirements (test step 4 above), review the payment amount to ensure it is accurate. If the claim is a SC burial claim, complete step 7. If the claim is a NSC claim, complete step 8. </p><p>7. Review the following payment requirements for SC burial claims&#58;<br>a. Review the &quot;Decision&quot; and &quot;Reasons for Decision&quot; sections of the Rating Decision to verify that the PMC determined the Veteran's death to be SC. (Note&#58; The &quot;Decision&quot; Section of the Rating Decision will most likely say something along the lines of &quot;Service connection for the cause of death is granted.&quot;)<br>b. Review the &quot;Amount&quot; section of the Award Document. Verify that the claimant received the correct reimbursement for funeral expenses. VA reimburses the claimant for the amount of expenses indicated on their invoice up to the following amounts for SC burials&#58;<br>\u2022 Burial Payment \u2013The full cost of the Veteran's burial up to a maximum amount of $2,000. <br>\u2022 Transportation Payment \u2013The cost of transporting the Veteran's body to the place of burial if the Veteran was buried in a national cemetery<br>(Note&#58; If the claimant qualifies for reimbursement of both, burial and transportation payments and the claimant was reimbursed the full amount of the burial payment ($2,000), the Award Document will list the reimbursements for these expenses individually. If the claimant qualifies for reimbursement of both, burial and transportation payments and the claimant was reimbursed an amount less than $2000 for the burial payment,&#160; VA lumps the burial and transportation reimbursement as one line item on the Award Document.)</p><p>8. Review all following payment requirements for NSC burial claims&#58;<br>a. Compare the date on the itemized invoice to the date on the VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Benefits (Field 34) to verify that the claimant filed the claim within two years of the burial or cremation of the Veteran. <br>b. One of the following conditions apply&#58;<br>i. Review the VETSNET- Award Information tab to determine whether the Veteran was in receipt of Pension, Compensation, or military retired pay at the time of death, or<br>ii. Inquire with process owners whether the Veteran had an original or reopened claim pending at the time of death and has been found entitled to Compensation or Pension from a date prior to the date of death, (Note&#58;&#160; VA would work the claim to determine if the claimant was eligible for the accrued benefit) or<br>iii. The deceased Veteran's proof of death, Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) records, and/or application indicate the Veteran died while hospitalized by VA, or<br>iv. The deceased Veteran's proof of death and/or application indicate that the Veteran died while receiving care under VA contract at a non-VA facility, or<br>v. The deceased Veteran's proof of death or CAPRI records indicate that the Veteran died while traveling, under proper authorization and at VA expense, to or from a specified place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care.<br>c. Review the &quot;Amount&quot; section of the Award Document. Verify that the claimant received the correct reimbursement for funeral expenses. VA reimburses the claimant for the amount of expenses indicated on their invoice up to the following amounts for NSC burials&#58;<br>\u2022 Burial Payment \u2013 VA reimburses the claimant $300, unless the Veteran died under VA care (see requirement 6.b.iv, above).

For example, if there are 23 claims greater than $25,000, select 22 claims that are $25,000 or less. </p><p>3. For each claim selected, request the following documentation&#58;<br>a. Signed and approved Award Document, <br>b. Veteran\u2019s application, including income and expenses (Note&#58; The Veteran\u2019s application should also display a U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) date stamp to evidence the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d), <br>c. Most recent evidence of the Veteran\u2019s mailing and payment address,<br>d. Notification of the Veteran\u2019s direct deposit information, such as the bank name, routing, and account number. (Note&#58; This information may be included in the Veteran\u2019s application. In addition, the Veteran could have provided a voided check listing his account and routing number, or separate documentation),<br>e. Screenshot of the Corporate Inquiry \u2013 Persons \u2013 All Relationships screen,<br>f. Any additional supporting documentation, such as marriage certificates, and children\u2019s\u2019 birth certificates, if applicable, that evidence proof of the Veteran\u2019s dependents, <br>g. Veterans\u2019 certified DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,<br>h. Personnel Information Exchange System (PIES) request response,<br>i.

Evidence to prove that the total withholdings, and<br>o. Evidence to prove that the effective date is accurate</p><p>4. For each claim selected, verify steps a through n below.<br>a. Verify that the \u201cDate of Claim\u201d within the Award Document matches the earliest VA date stamp indicated on the claimant's application for VA benefits. (The earliest date stamp must indicate &quot;VA RO&quot;).<br>b. Verify that the Veteran\u2019s name and Social Security Number (SSN) match the name and SSN listed on the Veteran\u2019s application. The Veteran submits an original claim for Veterans\u2019 Disability Pension benefits via VA Form 21-526 or 21-527EZ, Veteran\u2019s Application for Compensation and submits a re-opened claim for Veterans\u2019 Disability Pension benefits via VA Form 21-527, Income \u2013 Net Worth and Employment Statement. <br>c. Accuracy of Mailing/Payment Address&#58; The method for verifying the accuracy of the mailing and payment address varies depending on whether the Veteran is competent. To make this determination, review the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field within the Award Document.&#160; (Incorrect mailing and payments addresses can lead to returned payments and, as a result, proceeds. In addition, incorrect mailing and payment addresses can lead to improper payments if the wrong person accepts the payment.)<br>i. If the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field displays \u201cCompetent\u201d or if the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field indicates \u201cIncompetent\u201d and the \u201cFiduciary Status\u201d field displays \u201cSupervised Direct Pay\u201d (SDP), verify that the \u201cMailing Address\u201d on the Award Document matches the most recent evidence of the Veteran\u2019s mailing and payment address.&#160; If this is not correct, mark this as an exception. If the Veteran does not have direct deposit and the address is incorrect, request evidence to demonstrate that the beneficiary is receiving their benefits.&#160; <br>ii. If the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field indicates \u201cIncompetent,\u201d and the \u201cFiduciary Status\u201d field indicates that the beneficiary is assigned a fiduciary (e.g., spouse, temporary, etc.), verify that the \u201cMailing Address\u201d on the Award Document matches the most recent evidence of the fiduciary's mailing and payment address, which is evidenced on the VA Form 21-555, Certificate of Legal Capacity to Receive and Disburse Benefits and VETSNET-Change of Fiduciary (C-FID) Screen. If this is not correct, mark this as an exception.&#160; <br>d. Accuracy of Direct Deposit Information&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s application (Section XI) or direct deposit information that the Veteran submitted (i.e., copy of a voided check to indicate the routing and account numbers) to determine whether the Veteran has direct deposit. If the Veteran has direct deposit, ensure that the bank name, routing, and account number shown within the Award Document is correct. If the information is incorrect, the payment is going to the wrong account and can lead to an improper benefit payment. Mark this as an exception.&#160;&#160; <br>e. Dependency&#58; Verify the Veteran\u2019s dependents by matching the \u201cDependents\u201d field in the Award Document, the screenshot of the Corporate Inquiry \u2013 Persons \u2013 All Relationships screen, and additional supporting documentation, such as the Veteran\u2019s application, marriage certificates, and children\u2019s\u2019 birth certificates, if applicable. The \u201cAward Incd\u201d column of the Person Information tab indicates if the dependent is included in the Veteran\u2019s award. (Note&#58; VA does not require the Veteran to submit official documentation to evidence the existence of their dependents. In other words, the Pension Management Center (PMC) takes the Veteran\u2019s word, unless the PMC finds conflicting documentation.)&#160; Ensure that a dependent\u2019s name, date of birth, status (e.g., spouse, child, etc.) and SSN match. If the dependent is a child, ensure the child is under age 18 or under 23 and attending school. Incorrect dependency information can lead to an improper payment. <br>f. Service Requirements&#58; Review the Veterans\u2019 certified DD 214, PIES request response, or Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS)-VAD screen to verify the Veteran\u2019s service information. <br>i. Compare the DD 214, PIES request response, and/or BIRLS- VAD screen to the Award Document to ensure that the \u201cBranch\u201d (e.g., Army), \u201cDuty\u201d (e.g., Active Duty), \u201cEOD\u201d (Entrance on Duty),&#160; \u201cRAD\u201d (Release from Active Duty), and \u201cChar Disch\u201d (e.g., Honorable) fields match.&#160; <br>ii. Verify that the service documents and Award Document indicate the Veteran was discharged under honorable conditions. If the service documents and Award Document indicate otherwise, inquire with process owners whether an Administrative Decision was performed to permit the Veteran to be honorable for VA purposes.&#160; If the beneficiary was discharged under dishonorable conditions and was not rated honorable for VA purposes, mark this as an exception. <br>iii. Review the Veteran\u2019s DD 214 or PIES request response to verify that the Veteran meets service requirements in Table 8 in the Pension narrative.<br>iv. If there are discrepancies found in the test steps i-iii above, inquire with process owners as to why the PMC did not deny this claim. If the explanation is not acceptable, mark it as an exception because the Veteran should not have been eligible for Veterans\u2019 Disability Pension and the award is an improper benefit payment.<br>g. Net Worth Requirement&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s financial information in the net worth section of the application to determine whether it exceeds the maximum limit of $80,000. <br>i. If the Veteran\u2019s net worth does not exceed $80,000, continue to testing step h. <br>ii. If the Veteran\u2019s net worth does exceed $80,000, perform steps 1 and 2 below. <br>1) Verify that the net worth information submitted by the Veteran on VA Form 21-8049, Request for Details of Expenses was correctly input into VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate, which is the VSR\u2019s net worth decision. If this is a Fully Developed Claim (FDC) claim, verify that the net worth information submitted on the application was correctly input into VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate. Also, verify that the calculation of the years to deplete the net worth on VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate is accurate by dividing net worth by the difference between income and expenses. Compare this number with the life expectancy table within the VA manual.&#160; In general, if the Veteran will not spend their net worth within their lifetime, the VSR denies the claim. If the PMC approves a claim, in which the Veteran will not spend down their income within their lifetime, request process owners to provide an explanation. <br>2) Verify that two separate individuals signed the VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate. <br>h. Income Requirement&#58; To receive Pension benefits, the Income for VA Purposes (IVAP) must be less than the Maximum Annual Pension Rate (MAPR). VETSNET automatically determines whether a Veteran\u2019s IVAP exceeds the MAPR and will deny the claim for excessive income. Verify the following items to ensure the VSR entered the correct income information into VETSNET for the IVAP calculation. If the VSR entered incorrect income information, the calculation will not be correct. This could result in an incorrect eligibility determination, which would most likely lead to an improper payment.&#160; Once completed with testing steps i-iv below, proceed to step v for further direction.&#160; <br>i. Compare the Veteran\u2019s income and expense information on the most recent application or income change documentation to the SSA Inquiry results within Share.&#160; <br>1) If there is no discrepancy, verify that the income and expense information matches the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. <br>2) If there is a discrepancy, ensure that VA used the higher of the two income amounts on the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. Also, verify that the VSR accurately input the Veteran\u2019s self-reported expenses into VETSNET.&#160; <br>Note&#58; If the Veteran did not submit a Fully Developed Claim (FDC) claim, continue to step ii. If the Veteran submitted a FDC claim and reported that there is more than $5,000 in interest bearing assets (interest bearing accounts and stocks and bonds) but does not report interest or dividends, verify that the VSR input the correct interest rate into VETSNET. The correct interest rate is retrieved from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) website (<a href=\"http&#58;//www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/previous.html\">http&#58;//www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/previous.html</a> ) and corresponds to the week of the date of claim.&#160; If the VSR used the FDIC website to determine the interest rate ensure the VSR notified the Veteran of the amount entered into VETSNET and provided the Veteran with a chance to let the VA know if the interest amount deviated from this amount.<br>ii. Compare the Veteran\u2019s income types to Table 9 in the Pension narrative to determine whether the income types was included or excluded within VETSNET correctly. <br>iii. Determine if the Veteran claimed hardship within their application for benefits or if the Veteran has a dependent child with countable income. If the answer is yes to either of the questions, ensure that the VSR included the additional expenses and/or income within the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. <br>iv. Verify that the \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d and \u201cEvent Date\u201d fields within the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab are accurate.&#160; The \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d is the award effective date, which is generally the first of the month following the date of claim. (Note&#58; This is important to test because it affects the MAPR rate that VETSNET uses to calculate the income requirement.) The \u201cEvent Date\u201d is the date of claim (earliest VA RO date stamp).&#160; If the \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d or \u201cEvent Date\u201d fields are not accurate, mark an exception. <br>v. If there are discrepancies found in testing steps i-iv above, proceed to step 1 below. If there are no discrepancies found in testing steps i-iv above, proceed to step 2 below.<br>1) If there are discrepancies found in the test steps i-iv, mark them as an exception and inquire with process owners, as the IVAP or MAPR amounts in VETSNET are incorrect, which can result in an improper payment. <br>2) If there are no discrepancies or issues found in test step i-iv, review the \u201cIVAP\u201d and \u201cMAPR\u201d columns within the \u201cImproved Pension Award\u201d section of the Award Document and verify the Veteran\u2019s IVAP does not exceed the MAPR.&#160; <br>i. Determine if the Veteran is 65 years or older by reviewing the Veteran\u2019s application and the results from the Veteran\u2019s SSA Inquiry. <br>i. If the Veteran is 65 years or older, proceed to testing step j below.<br>ii. If the Veteran is not 65 years or older, review evidence and the SSA Inquiry results to determine whether the Veteran resides in a nursing home or receiving disability benefits. If the Veteran is in a nursing home or receiving disability benefits, proceed to step k below. <br>iii. If the Veteran is not in a nursing home or receiving disability benefits, the PMC must rate the Veteran\u2019s claim. Verify that the Rating Decision agrees with the decision to deny or award the claim.<br>j. Request evidence that the total withholdings in the \u201cTotal W/H\u201d column of the \u201cImproved Pension\u201d section of the Award Document are accurate. <br>k. If the \u201cDis. Lvl\u201d column within the &quot;Improved Pension Award&quot; section of the Award Document indicates the Veteran receives either Aid and Attendance (PT-A&amp;A) or Housebound (PT-HB) benefits, review \u201cDecision\u201d and \u201cReasons for Decision\u201d sections of the Rating Decision to verify that the Veteran meets SMP requirements. <br>l. Verify the effective date in the \u201cEff Date\u201d column of the \u201cImproved Pension\u201d section of the Award Document is accurate. The Effective date should be the first month following the date of claim. (If the claim required a rating, verify that the effective date listed in the Rating Decision corresponds to the \u201cEff Date\u201d field on the Award Document.)<br>m. The VSR's signature should be in the &quot;Generated by&quot; field on the Award Document. Verify that a VCE authorized the award. The IDs should be different for the generation and authorization.<br>n. If the award is in excess of $25,000, verify that a Coach or designee concurred with the award within VETSNET-Awards. The individual who concurred the decision must have a different ID from the individuals who generated and authorized the award.<br></p></div>","Control_Status":"A.

Verify that there is only one &quot;CDP Spouse&quot; tab in VETSNET, as more than one can indicate duplicate spouses. <br>d. Accuracy of Mailing/Payment Address&#58; The method for verifying the accuracy of the mailing and payment address varies depending on whether the beneficiary is competent. To make this determination, review the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field within the Award Document.&#160; (Incorrect mailing and payments addresses can lead to returned payments and, as a result, proceeds. In addition, incorrect mailing and payment addresses can lead to improper payments if the wrong person accepts the payment.)<br>iii. If the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field displays \u201cCompetent\u201d or if the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field indicates \u201cIncompetent\u201d and the \u201cFiduciary Status\u201d field displays \u201cSupervised Direct Pay\u201d (SDP), verify that the \u201cMailing Address\u201d on the Award Document matches the most recent evidence of the Veteran\u2019s mailing and payment address.&#160; If this is not correct, mark this as an exception. If the Veteran does not have direct deposit and the address is incorrect, request evidence to demonstrate that the beneficiary is receiving their benefits.&#160; <br>iv. If the \u201cCompetent Status\u201d field indicates \u201cIncompetent,\u201d and the \u201cFiduciary Status\u201d field indicates that the claimant is assigned a fiduciary (e.g., spouse, temporary, etc.), verify that the \u201cMailing Address\u201d on the Award Document matches the most recent evidence of the fiduciary's mailing and payment address, which is evidenced on the VA Form 21-555, Certificate of Legal Capacity to Receive and Disburse Benefits and VETSNET-C-FID Screen. If this is not correct, mark this as an exception.&#160; <br>e. Accuracy of Direct Deposit Information&#58; If the VA awarded the benefit to the claimant perform this step. If not, continue to step f. Review the claimant's application or direct deposit information that the claimant submitted (e.g., copy of a voided check to indicate the routing and account numbers) to determine whether the claimant has direct deposit. If the claimant has direct deposit, ensure that the bank name, routing, and account number shown within the Award Document is correct. If the information is incorrect, the payment is going to the wrong account and can lead to an improper benefit payment. Mark this as an exception. <br>f. Dependency&#58; Determine whether the claimant has dependents by reviewing the Award Document. If the claimant does not have benefits, continue to step g. Verify the beneficiary\u2019s dependents by matching the \u201cDependents\u201d field in the Award Document, the screenshot of the Corporate Inquiry \u2013 Persons \u2013 All Relationships screen, and additional supporting documentation, such as the beneficiary\u2019s application, marriage certificates, and children\u2019s birth certificates, if applicable. The \u201cAward Incd\u201d column of the Person Information tab indicates if the dependent is included in the claimant\u2019s award. (Note&#58; VA does not require the beneficiary to submit official documentation to evidence the existence of their dependents. In other words, the PMC takes the word of the beneficiary, unless the PMC finds conflicting documentation.)&#160; Ensure that a dependent\u2019s name, date of birth, status (a beneficiary\u2019s e.g., spouse) and SSN match. If the dependent is a child, ensure the child is under age 18 or under 23 if attending school. Incorrect dependency information can lead to an improper payment. Mark this as an exception.<br>g. Relationship to Veteran&#58; Determine whether the beneficiary meets the requirements for their relationship to the Veteran for each type of claim.<br>i. Survivors\u2019 Death Pension&#58; An un-remarried surviving spouse and/or unmarried children of a deceased wartime Veteran are eligible to receive Survivors\u2019 Death Pension benefits. Compare the Veteran\u2019s dependency information on the death certificate and Veteran\u2019s past application to the claimant\u2019s application to ensure that the beneficiary is the surviving spouse and/or child. <br>1) If the Veteran\u2019s dependency information and beneficiary\u2019s application match, the claimant meets the relationship to the Veteran requirement. <br>2) If there are discrepancies between the Veteran\u2019s application and the beneficiary\u2019s application, review supporting documentation, such as a new marriage license and child\u2019s birth certificate, to support the relationship of an un-remarried surviving spouse or unmarried child of a deceased wartime Veteran. If there is not sufficient evidence to evidence that the Veteran and beneficiary are related, inquire with process owners as to why the PMC did not deny this claim. If process owners\u2019 explanation is not acceptable, mark the claim as an exception because this beneficiary should not have been eligible to receive Survivors\u2019 Death Pension benefits and the award is an improper benefit payment.<br>ii. DIC&#58; A surviving spouse or child is eligible to receive DIC benefits. Compare the Veteran\u2019s dependency information on the deceased Veteran\u2019s death certificate or past application to the beneficiary\u2019s application to ensure that the claimant is a surviving spouse and/or child. Additionally review the claim and evidence to ensure the following&#58; <br>1) For surviving spouse, verify the spouse qualified for one of the following&#58;<br>a. Validly married the Veteran, or<br>b. Married to a service member who died on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, or<br>c. Married the Veteran within 15 years of discharge from the period of military service in which the disease or injury that caused the Veteran\u2019s death began or was aggravated, or<br>d. Married to the Veteran for at least one year, or<br>e. Had a child with the Veteran, and cohabited with the Veteran continuously until the Veteran\u2019s death or, if separated, was not at fault for the separation, and is not currently remarried.<br>Exception&#58;&#160; A surviving spouse, who remarries on or after December 16, 2003, and on or after attaining age 57, is entitled to continue to receive DIC.<br>2) For a surviving child, verify the following&#58;<br>a. Not included on the surviving spouse\u2019s DIC,<br>b. Unmarried, and<br>c. Over age 18 or over 23 and attending school.<br>If there are discrepancies, inquire with process owners as to why the PMC did not deny this claim. If process owners\u2019 explanation is not acceptable, mark this claim as an exception because this beneficiary should not have been eligible to receive DIC benefits and the award is an improper benefit payment.<br>iii. Parents\u2019 DIC&#58; For a Parent\u2019s DIC claim, a surviving parent of a Veteran is eligible. Verify that the beneficiary is a surviving parent by reviewing the following documentation&#58;<br>1) Natural Parent&#58; Veteran\u2019s birth certificate showing the name of the natural parent(s).<br>2) Adoptive Parents&#58;&#160; Copy of the final decree of adoption and revised birth certificate.<br>3) Foster Parent&#58;&#160; VA Form 21-524, Statement of a Person Claiming to Have Stood in Relation of Parent. <br>Additionally, after the basic parental relationship is verified, review supporting evidence to determine whether the parent is in the following martial situations&#58;<br>\u2022 Sole surviving parent (unremarried or remarried but not living with the spouse,<br>\u2022 Sole surviving Parent (remarried and living with spouse),<br>\u2022 One of two living parents (not living with a spouse), or<br>\u2022 One of two living parents (living with a spouse or other parent).<br>Compare the parent\u2019s marital status to the monthly Parents\u2019 DIC rate table to ensure the beneficiary is receiving the correct rate.<br>h. Service Requirement&#58; Compare the Veteran's DD 214, PIES request response, or Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) VADS screen to the Award Document to determine whether the Veteran meets the service requirements specific for each type of claim. If there are discrepancies, inquire with process owners as to why the PMC did not deny this claim. <br>i. Survivors\u2019 Death Pension&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s DD 214,&#160; PIES request&#160; response, or BIRLS VADS screen to verify that the Veteran qualified for one of the following&#58;<br>1) Served on active duty for at least 90 consecutive days, at least one day of which was during a wartime period. Review Table X within the Pension narrative. <br>2) If less than 90 days, was discharged because of disability for which service connection could be established without resort to any presumptive provisions of the law. <br>3) Had a disability for which service connection was established. This would have resulted in a discharge for disability.<br>4) Had two or more separate periods of active service for an aggregate of 90 days or more during more than one period of war.&#160; <br>5) If a Veteran dies while on active duty under circumstances precluding payment of service-connected (SC) benefits (e.g., the death was not in line of duty, or was the result of willful misconduct), the Veteran must have served honorably for at least two years. Part of this service must be during a wartime period, but there is no time requirement for the wartime service. <br>If the Veteran\u2019s service was less than 90 days and the VA awarded the claim, request the beneficiary\u2019s Rating Decision to verify that it agrees with the decision to deny or award the claim.&#160; If not, mark this claim as an exception.<br>ii. DIC&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s DD 214, PIES request response, or BIRLS VADS screen to verify that the beneficiary (surviving spouse or child) is submitting an application as a survivor of a Veteran. Generally, there is not a minimum active duty service requirement. The exception is if the Veteran\u2019s cause of death was a chronic disease and VA did not address the issue during the Veteran\u2019s lifetime there is a 90-day length of service requirement. <br>iii. Parents\u2019 DIC&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s DD 214, PIES request response, or BIRLS VADS screen to verify that the beneficiary (surviving parent) is submitting an application as a survivor of a Veteran. Generally, there is not a minimum active duty service requirement. VA considers National Guard and Reserve members who activated for Federal military service and later separated as Veterans. In addition, VA considers Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration active duty members and Veterans, once discharged.<br>i. Veterans Death Requirement&#58; Review the Veteran\u2019s proof of death, which is generally the Veteran\u2019s death certificate, to ensure the beneficiary is eligible for Survivor Benefits.<br>i. Survivors\u2019 Death Pension&#58; Verify the Veteran\u2019s death by reviewing a copy of the Veteran\u2019s death certificate or other proof of death. <br>ii. DIC&#58; Verify the Veteran\u2019s death by reviewing a copy of the Veteran\u2019s death certificate or other proof of death. Additionally, review the death certificate and the Veteran\u2019s Rating Decision to verify that the Veteran\u2019s cause of death is due to one of the following&#58;<br>1) Military service member who died while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, or<br>2) Veteran whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease, or<br>3) Veteran whose death resulted from a non-service-related injury or disease, and who was receiving, or was entitled to receive, VA Compensation for SC disability that was rated as totally disabling<br>a. For at least 10 years immediately before death, or<br>b. Since the Veteran\u2019s release from active duty and for at least five years immediately preceding death, or<br>c. For at least one year before death if the Veteran was a former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999. <br>If there is no proof of the Veteran\u2019s death, mark the claim as an exception.<br>iii. Parents\u2019 DIC&#58; Review a copy of the Veteran\u2019s death certificate or any supporting documentation to evidence the Veteran\u2019s death was SC.&#160; If there is no proof of the Veteran\u2019s death, mark the claim as an exception.<br>j. For DIC and Parents\u2019 DIC claims, complete test step i. below. If this is not a DIC or a Parents\u2019 DIC claim, proceed to testing step k.<br>i. Review the Rating Decision to verify the Veteran that has one of the following&#58;<br>1) At least one SC disability or disease evaluated at 50% or more disabling, or<br>2) 100% SC disability or disease, or<br>3) Entitled to individual unemployability.<br>In addition, verify that that the Rating Decision agrees with the decision to deny or award the claim.&#160; If the Rating Decision and Award Document do not agree, mark the claim as an exception.</p><p>k. Net Worth Requirement&#58; Complete this testing step for Survivors\u2019 Death Pension only. Review the survivor\u2019s financial information in the net worth section of his application to determine whether it exceeds the maximum limit of $80,000. <br>i. If the survivor\u2019s net worth does not exceed $80,000, continue to testing step l. If the survivor\u2019s net worth does exceed $80,000, continue to steps ii and iii below.. <br>ii. If the survivor\u2019s net worth does exceed $80,000, verify that the net worth information submitted by the survivor on VA Form 21-8049, Request for Details of Expenses was correctly input into VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate, which is the VSR\u2019s net worth decision. If this is a Fully Developed Claim (FDC) claim, verify that the net worth information submitted on the application was correctly input into VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate. Also, verify that the calculation of the years to deplete the net worth on VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate is accurate by dividing net worth by the difference between income and expenses. Compare this number with the life expectancy table within the VA manual.&#160; In general, if the survivor will not spend their net worth within their life expectancy, the VSR denies the claim. If the PMC approves a claim, in which the survivor will not spend down their net worth within their life expectancy, request process owners to provide an explanation. Mark an exception if the process owners\u2019 explanation is not acceptable because this beneficiary should not have been eligible and the award is an improper benefit payment. Proceed to step iv. <br>iii. Verify that two separate individuals signed the VA Form 21-5427, Corpus of Estate.<br>l. Income Requirement&#58; If this is a DIC award, proceed to step m. <br>i. Survivors\u2019 Death Pension and Parents DIC&#58; (Note&#58; Income for Parents\u2019 DIC is counted on a calendar year basis and&#160; their rate is dependent on not only their income, but their marital status as well.) To receive Pension benefits, the IVAP must be less than the MAPR. VETSNET automatically determines whether a survivor\u2019s IVAP exceeds the MAPR and will deny the claim for excessive income. Verify the following items to ensure the VSR entered the correct income information into VETSNET for the IVAP calculation. If the VSR entered incorrect income information, the calculation will not be correct. This could result in an incorrect eligibility determination, which would most likely lead to an improper payment.&#160; Once completed with testing steps i-iv below, proceed to step v for further direction.&#160; <br>1) Compare the survivor\u2019s income and expense information on the most recent application or income change documentation to the SSA Inquiry results within Share.&#160; <br>a. If there is no discrepancy, verify that the income and expense information matches the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. <br>b. If there is a discrepancy, ensure that VA used the higher of the two income amounts on the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. Also, verify that the VSR accurately input the survivor\u2019s self-reported expenses into VETSNET.&#160; <br>2) If the claim / application is for FDC, claims perform step 2. If not, continue to step 3. If the survivor reports that there is more than $5,000 in interest bearing assets (interest bearing accounts and stocks and bonds) but does not report interest or dividends, verify that the VSR input the correct interest rate into VETSNET. The correct interest rate corresponds to the week of the date of claim (found on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) website <a href=\"http&#58;//www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/previous.html\">http&#58;//www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/previous.html</a> ).&#160; If the VSR used the FDIC website to determine the interest rate ensure the VSR notified the survivor of the amount entered into VETSNET and provided the survivor with a chance to let the VA know if the interest amount deviated from this amount.<br>3) Compare the income type to Table 8 in the Pension narrative to determine whether it was included or excluded correctly. <br>4) Determine if the survivor has claimed hardship within his application for benefits or if the survivor has a dependent child with countable income. If the answer is yes to either of these questions, ensure that the VSR included the additional expenses and/or income into VETSNET by reviewing the screenshot of the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab. If the VSR did not include this information, the IVAP calculation could be incorrect.<br>5) Verify that the \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d and \u201cEvent Date\u201d fields within the VETSNET-Award \u2013 Financial \u2013 Financial Decision tab are accurate.&#160; The \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d is the award effective date, which is generally the first of the month following the date of claim. (Note&#58; This is important to test because it affects the MAPR rate that VETSNET uses to calculate the income requirement.) The \u201cEvent Date\u201d is the date of claim (earliest VA RO date stamp).&#160; If the \u201cFinancial Decision Effective Date\u201d or \u201cEvent Date\u201d fields are not accurate, mark an exception. <br>6) If there are discrepancies found in testing steps 1-5 above, proceed to step a below. If there are no discrepancies found in testing steps 1-5 above, proceed to step b below.<br>a. If there are discrepancies found in the test steps 1-5 above, mark them as exceptions and inquire with process owners, as the IVAP or MAPR amounts in VETSNET are incorrect, which can result in an improper payment. <br>b. If there are no discrepancies or issues found in test step 1-5 above, review the \u201cIVAP\u201d and \u201cMAPR\u201d columns within the \u201cImproved Pension Award\u201d section of the Award Document and verify that the beneficiary\u2019s IVAP does not exceed the MAPR.<br>m. If the \u201cDis. Lvl\u201d column within the &quot;Improved Pension Award&quot; section of the Award Document indicates the Veteran receives either Aid and Attendance (PT-A&amp;A) or Housebound (PT-HB) benefits, review \u201cDecision\u201d and \u201cReasons for Decision\u201d sections of the claimant\u2019s Rating Decision to verify that the Veteran meets Special Monthly Pension (SMP) requirements. <br>n. Request evidence that the total withholdings in the \u201cTotal W/H\u201d column on the Award Document are accurate. <br>o. Request evidence that the effective date in the \u201cEff Date\u201d column of the \u201cImproved Pension\u201d section of the Award Document is accurate. The Effective Date should be the first month following the date of claim. (If the claim required a rating, verify that the effective date listed in the Rating Decision corresponds to the \u201cEff Date\u201d field on the Award Document.)<br>p. The VSR's signature should be in the &quot;Generated by&quot; field on the Award Document. Also, verify that a VCE authorized the award. The IDs should be different for the generation and authorization.<br>q. If the award is in excess of $25,000, verify that a Coach or designee concurred with the award within VETSNET-Awards. The individual who concurred the decision must have a different ID from the individuals who generated and authorized the award.<br></p></div>","Control_Status":"A.

Verify that the VA paid the correct beneficiary. Accrued benefits are payable to the living person in the following order&#58;<br>a. In full to the surviving spouse; <br>b. In equal shares to the Veteran\u2019s children (Note&#58;&#160; Children do not include adult children);<br>c. In equal shares to the Veteran\u2019s parents, if dependent upon the Veteran at the date of the Veteran\u2019s death; <br>d. In full to the sole surviving parent, if dependent upon the Veteran at the date of the Veteran\u2019s death; or<br>e. If there are no living persons who are entitled to accrued benefits based on relationship, VA will reimburse the person(s) who paid for or is responsible to pay the expenses of last illness and burial of a Veteran. <br>The VA usually takes the claimant\u2019s word whether they are related to the deceased Veteran. However, if the deceased Veteran adopted the claimant, the claimant must submit adoption documents to prove they are related to the deceased Veteran. An improper benefit payment occurs if the VA paid the incorrect claimant and/or paid an inaccurate amount. Mark this as an exception.&#160;&#160; </p><p>7. If the claimant is not related to the Veteran, complete step 7. If not, proceed to step 8. Review the bill or invoice that evidences the beneficiary paid for the expenses of the Veteran\u2019s last illness and burial. Ensure that the claimant paid the invoice or last expenses in full. In addition, verify that the VA only paid the amount the beneficiary paid for unrelated parties, not the amount the Veteran would have received if alive.&#160; </p><p>8. Request evidence that the effective date in the \u201cEff Date\u201d column of the Award Document is accurate. </p><p>9. Based on the type of claim, verify that the claim met all requirements.

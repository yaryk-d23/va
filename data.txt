FAS is initially supporting the financial business functionality of the C&P system. It meets the Core Financial System Requirements outlined in the Federal Financial Management System Requirements publication (FFMSR-1) authored by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP). FAS is being built so that it can be used by other VBA benefit programs, thus providing a single system which is fully compliant with current accounting requirements. In addition to the current BDN functionality, FAS provides the ability to perform on-line transaction processing and on-line audit functions, and has automated manual review processes such as Check Verification, Fiscal Adjustments (FISA), Review of account with prior Waiver or Write Off adjustments. The system interfaces daily with the Financial Management System, allows for a systematic review of client accounts, provides a business transaction boundary, and performs daily payment processing.

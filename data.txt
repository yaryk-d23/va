These methodologies were needed because VA does not have adequate processes in place to estimate and accrue the cost of care at the detail transaction level within VA\u2019s financial management system (FMS). As a result, there was inadequate or no documentation provided to support various amounts and/or data inputs in Veterans Affairs Whitepapers.

Additionally, the current lookback analysis provided by management did not examine the impact of the adjustments on the accrued liability balances reported in its white paper or provide documentation of management\u2019s expectations.

The reporting process requires significant manual intervention to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial reporting. It should be noted however, that of the $124 billion Minx JVs reported in the table below, $69 billion of the FY 2019 JV total as of 3/31 were related to the following routine adjustments&#58; $35 billion in trading partner main account adjustments; $20 billion in beginning balance roll-forward adjustments; $7.6 billion in internal eliminations; and $6.5 billion in distributed offsetting receipts.  The trading partner main adjustments do not change how balances are reported on the financial statements and carry very little risk of contributing to a material misstatement.  The beginning balance roll-forward adjustments are necessary to ensure current year beginning balances align with the prior year ending balances.  Additionally, adjustments for internal eliminations and distributed offsetting receipts are financial statement presentation adjustments and do not affect the underlying adjusted trial balance at the Treasury Account Symbol level and not reported in GTAS.  Although there was reduction in the use of FMS JVs in particular, the reliance on JV\u2019s was still prevalent as of 3/31.

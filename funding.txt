These methodologies were needed because VA does not have adequate processes in place to estimate and accrue the cost of care at the detail transaction level within VA\u2019s financial management system (FMS). As a result, there was inadequate or no documentation provided to support various amounts and/or data inputs in Veterans Affairs Whitepapers.  Management did not provide documentation that supported the reconciliation of financial data in the white papers to the FMS general ledger.  Lookback analysis of prior adjustments made to Funds 0140 and 0172 were not performed correctly, and not adequately verified by management.

Management recorded a total of $29 billion in absolute value via MinX adjustments to the General Ledger (GL) with all trading partners (including VA) as of September 30, 2019. Although many of these adjustments have no impact on the GL balance, this supports the overall condition on the extensive reliance on journal vouchers (JV or JVs) (described further in the previously issued NFRs 19-3 and 19-3a Financial Systems and Reporting). For instance, VA must manually add the TP main account code for GTAS submission. It is a requirement in GTAS that the bulk files contain the correct three-digit trading partner and four-digit main account. Hence, JVs are needed to reclassify balances for TP \"020\" to \"0200550\" due to FMS system limitations. As part of our Q4 JV testing, there were 6 JVs selected ($27 billion) that related to this type of adjustment and contributed to 95% of the total adjustments ($29 billion) noted above.","NFR_DocumentId":121,"FYId":2,"RepeatFinding":false,"FindingAnalysis":null,"SeverityRating":null,"ContentTypeId":"0x01005E93C1D580A3064B93BA2C3F56B862DD","Grouping":"Finding","ComplianceAssetId":null,"Findings_DocumentsId":121,"Origin_x0020_of_x0020_Finding":null,"Comments":null,"Finding_x002d_Report_x0020_Title":null,"Business_x0020_Process_x0020_AreId":1,"ID":313,"Modified":"2020-08-13T16:18:48Z","Created":"2020-04-23T20:12:02Z","AuthorId":13,"EditorId":465,"OData__UIVersionString":"1.0","Attachments":false,"GUID":"4468dbca-ff4f-4e9e-a55d-843e3d24f5bc"},{"odata.type":"SP.Data.FindingsListItem","odata.id":"2b98365d-1f0b-4750-afce-ecb4474b7e5b","odata.etag":"\"3\"","odata.editLink":"Web/Lists(guid'249e2aaf-3ba3-4607-a539-deb3c81e8c16')/Items(314)","FileSystemObjectType":0,"Id":314,"ServerRedirectedEmbedUri":null,"ServerRedirectedEmbedUrl":"","Title":"Intragovernmental Transaction (IGT) Difference by Trading Partner Report","FindingNo":"NFR 19-02b-02","FindingDescription":"Based on FY 2019 Q4 IGT Difference by TP Report, there were TP differences of approximately $5.375 billion (absolute value).
